    "The Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) project calculate a Stringency Index, a composite measure of nine of the response metrics (or individual indicators).\n",
    "\n",
    "The individual indicators capture all government measures related to a specific domain, including formally adopted laws, policies promulgated by executive or regulatory authorities, and softer guidance or advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are categorized into 5 groups:\n",
    "* **C** - containment and closure policies\n",
    "* **E** - economic policies\n",
    "* **H** - health system policies\n",
    "* **M** - miscellaneous policies\n",
    "* **V** - vaccination policies\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to describe government responses in aggregate, OxCGRT calculates simple indices that combine individual indicators to provide an overall measure of the intensity of government response across a family of indicators. These indices are designed to provide a simple snapshot of the number and degree of government responses in a particular domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "OxCGRT publishes four indices that group different families of policy indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Government response index or \"GRI\" (all categories)\n",
    "* Stringency index (containment and closure policies, sometimes referred to as lockdown policies)\n",
    "* Containment and health index or \"CHI\" (containment and closure and health policies)\n",
    "* Economic support index or \"ESI\" (economic support measures)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each index is composed of a series of individual policy response indicators. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each indicator, the authors created a score by taking the ordinal value and subtracting half a point if the policy is targeted rather than general, if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then they rescaled each of these by their maximum value to create a score between 0 and 100, with a missing value contributing 0. These scores are then averaged to obtain the composite indices. \n",
    "This calculation is described in equation (1) below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$index = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum \\limits _{j=1} ^{k} I_{j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where k is the number of component indicators in an index and $I_{j}$ is the sub-index score of an individual indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each subindex score (I) for any given indicator (j) on any given day (t) is calculated by the function described in equation below based on the following parameters:\n",
    "* The maximum value of the indicator $N_{j}$\n",
    "* Whether that indicator has a flag ($F_{j} =1 $ if the indicator has a flag variable and $F_{j} =0 $  if the indicator does not have a flag variable)\n",
    "* The recorded policy value on the ordinal scale ($v_{j,t}$)\n",
    "* The recorded binary flag for that indicator ($f_{j,t}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "This normalizes the different ordinal scales to produce a subindex score between 0 and 100, where each full point on the ordinal scale is equally spaced. For indicators that do have a flag variable, if this flag is recorded as 0 (so measures are targeted) this is treated as a half-step between ordinal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "$I_{j,t} = 100 \\frac{v_{j,t} - 0,5(F_{j}-f_{j,t})}{N_{j}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. The database only contains flag values if the indicator has a non-zero value. If a government has no policy for a given indicator (that is, the indicator equals zero), the corresponding flag is blank/null in the database. For the purpose of calculating the index, this is equivalent to a subindex score of zero. In other words, $ I_{j,t}=0 $ if $ v_{j,t}=0 $ ( if $v_{j,t}=0$, the function $F_{j}-f_{j,t}$ is also treated as 0. "

This indicator uses ordinal values and ranks the policies on a simple numerical scale that goes from 0 (no measures) to 3 (require closing all levels). It has an additional flag variable that can be either 0 (targeted - valid for individual school districts) or 1 (general - all schools in a jurisdiction are closed).\n",
    "    * **C2- Workplace closing**: it records closings of workplaces. Its values can go from 0 (no measures) to 3 ( require closing (or work from home) for all-but-essential workplaces (eg grocery stores, doctors)). It has an additional flag variable that can be either 0 (targeted) or 1 (general).\n",

    "    * **C4 - Restrictions on gatherings**: it records limits on gatherings. Its values can go from 0 (no restrictions) to 4 (restrictions on gatherings of 10 people or less). It has an additional flag variable that can be either 0 (targeted) or 1 (general).\n",
    "    * **C5 - Close public transport**: it records closing of public transport. Its values can go from 0 (no measures) to 2 (require closing (or prohibit most citizens from using it)). It has an additional flag variable that can be either 0 (targeted) or 1 (general).\n",
    "    * **C6 - Stay at home requirements**: it records orders to \"shelter-in-place\" and otherwise confine to the home. Its values can go from 0 (no measures) to 3 (require not leaving house with minimal exceptions (eg allowed to leave once a week, or only one person can leave at a time, etc)). It has an additional flag variable that can be either 0 (targeted) or 1 (general).\n",
    "    * **C7 - Restrictions on internal movement**: it records restrictions on internal movement between cities/regions. Its values can go from 0 (no measures) to 2 (internal movement restrictions in place). It has an additional flag variable that can be either 0 (targeted) or 1 (general).\n",
    "    * **C8 - International travel controls**: it records restrictions on international travel (for foreign travellers, not citizens). Its values can go from 0 (no measures) to 4 (ban on all regions or total border closure). It has an additional flag variable that can be either 0 (targeted) or 1 (general).\n",

Its values can go from 0 (no Covid-19 public information campaign) to 2 (coordinated public information campaign (eg across traditional and social media)). It has an additional flag variable that can be either 0 (targeted) or 1 (general).\n",
